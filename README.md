# a-simple-calculator
A simple calculator made in Unix. This is a console-based program that functions as a simple pocket calculator, where MS allows storing of the result, M+ adds on to the previous result, MR recalls the stored result, and MC clears memory. 
C clears the result and keeps memory, and X exits the program.
